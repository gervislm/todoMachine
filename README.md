# Project TodoMachine with React

## Description

This React tasks project is a web application that allows you to create, modify and delete tasks. It is built using the React JavaScript library, which makes it easy to create interactive and efficient user interfaces.

## Features

1. **Create Tasks**: Users can add new tasks by specifying a title and description.

2. **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Users can mark a task as completed and vice versa.

3. **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks that are no longer necessary.

4. **Data Persistence**: Tasks are stored locally in the user's browser so that they persist even after closing the application.

## Facility

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/gervislm/todoMachine.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd todoMachine
    ```

3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

    either

    ```
    yarn install
    ```

## Use

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the application using the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser. Now you can start using the app to manage your tasks.

   - **index.js**: Application input file that renders the application to the DOM.
